# 🔍 CT-Crimes — AI4ALL Crime Prediction Project

**CT-Crimes** is a collaborative machine learning project developed during the **AI4ALL Fellowship** by **Kenneth Maeda, Manushri Pendekanti, and Min Thaw Zin**.  

The project explores how artificial intelligence can be applied to predict and analyze reported crimes across Connecticut using real-world, publicly available data.

Using datasets from the **FBI Crime Data Explorer** and the **Connecticut Open Data Portal**, the team built a full end-to-end ML pipeline for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  
Models include **LightGBM**, **Random Forest**, and a custom **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** integrating spatial, temporal, and environmental features.  

Class imbalance is handled through **SMOTE**, and interpretability tools visualize feature influence and regional crime patterns.

The project also includes a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive predictions and data exploration, enabling users to visualize trends and understand model outputs in real time.
