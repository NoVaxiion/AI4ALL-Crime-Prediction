# 🔍 CT-Crimes — AI4ALL Ignite Crime Prediction Project

**CT-Crimes** is a collaborative machine learning project developed during the **AI4ALL Ignite Fellowship** by **Kenneth Maeda**, **Manushri Pendekanti**, and **Min Thaw Zin**.  

The project investigates how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to predict and analyze reported crimes across Connecticut using real-world, publicly available data.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Outcomes
Uncovered meaningful spatial and temporal crime patterns by engineering a full end-to-end ML pipeline for Connecticut’s public safety data.  

Applied data preprocessing, model optimization, and interpretability techniques to build an ethical, explainable AI system aligned with **AI4ALL Ignite’s mission** of advancing AI for social good.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Crime remains a critical social issue impacting safety, resource allocation, and policy decisions. Yet, predictive tools for localized crime analysis are often inaccessible or limited.  

**CT-Crimes** addresses this gap by building an interpretable model that forecasts regional crime trends—empowering communities and decision-makers with insights for proactive safety measures and data-driven interventions.

## 📊 Key Results
- Processed and integrated **360K+ records** from the **FBI Crime Data Explorer** and **Connecticut Open Data Portal**
- Engineered **spatial**, **temporal**, and **environmental** feature sets to improve predictive accuracy
- Trained multiple models: **LightGBM**, **Random Forest**, and a **custom Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- Implemented **SMOTE** to mitigate severe class imbalance
- Built an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization and predictions

## ⚙️ Methodologies
To achieve the project goals, the team:
- Designed and executed an **end-to-end data pipeline** for ingestion, cleaning, and transformation  
- Implemented **multi-model training and evaluation** using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Applied **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** for balanced learning  
- Developed a **Streamlit dashboard** for inference, visualization, and user interactivity  
- Leveraged **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods to visualize feature influence and model transparency

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we gained valuable technical and research experience across the full machine learning lifecycle — from data acquisition to deployment and bias evaluation. Key takeaways include:

* **End-to-End ML Development:** Learned how to design, train, and evaluate machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, DNNs) on large-scale structured datasets.  
* **Data Ethics & Bias Analysis:** Understood the ethical implications of AI in law enforcement, identifying and mitigating sources of data bias through comparative evaluation and fairness metrics.  
* **Feature Engineering & Model Optimization:** Practiced transforming raw data into meaningful features, tuning hyperparameters, and balancing model complexity with interpretability.  
* **Data Visualization & Communication:** Strengthened skills in presenting technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences using visual analytics and dashboards.  
* **Collaborative Research:** Worked within the **AI4ALL Ignite** mentorship framework, collaborating with peers and mentors to conduct research aligned with real-world AI for social good principles.  
* **Practical AI Deployment:** Built an interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time prediction and visualization — bridging the gap between data science prototypes and accessible public tools.  

> These experiences reinforced our belief that **responsible AI is not just about accuracy, but about accountability, transparency, and impact**.
