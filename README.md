# 🔍 CT-Crimes — AI4ALL Crime Prediction Project

CT-Crimes is a collaborative machine learning project developed during the AI4ALL Fellowship by Kenneth Maeda, Manushri Pendekanti, and Min Thaw Zin. The project explores how artificial intelligence can be applied to predict and analyze reported crimes across Connecticut using real-world, publicly available data.

Using datasets from the FBI Crime Data Explorer and the Connecticut Open Data Portal, the team built a full end-to-end ML pipeline that handles data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Models include LightGBM, Random Forest, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN) integrating spatial, temporal, and environmental features. Class imbalance is addressed through SMOTE, and interpretability tools help visualize feature influence and regional crime patterns.

The project also includes a Streamlit dashboard for interactive predictions and data exploration, allowing users to visualize trends and understand model outputs in real time.

💡 Key Features:

• Multi-model architecture (LightGBM, Random Forest, DNN)
• Spatial, temporal, and environmental feature integration
• SMOTE for class balancing
• Interactive Streamlit visualization and inference dashboard
• Reproducible configuration and modular design

⚙️ Status:
The project is under active development, with ongoing bug fixes and performance improvements planned to enhance model stability and dashboard reliability.

⚖️ For educational and research use only.
Developed under the AI4ALL Fellowship to promote ethical, interpretable, and community-centered AI for public data analysis.
