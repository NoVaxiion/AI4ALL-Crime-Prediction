# 🔍 CT-Crimes — AI4ALL Ignite Crime Prediction Project

**CT-Crimes** is a collaborative machine learning project developed during the **AI4ALL Ignite Fellowship** by **Kenneth Maeda**, **Manushri Pendekanti**, and **Min Thaw Zin**.  

The project investigates how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to predict and analyze reported crimes across Connecticut using real-world, publicly available data.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Outcomes
Uncovered meaningful spatial and temporal crime patterns by engineering a full end-to-end ML pipeline for Connecticut’s public safety data.  

Applied data preprocessing, model optimization, and interpretability techniques to build an ethical, explainable AI system aligned with **AI4ALL Ignite’s mission** of advancing AI for social good.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Crime remains a critical social issue impacting safety, resource allocation, and policy decisions. Yet, predictive tools for localized crime analysis are often inaccessible or limited.  

**CT-Crimes** addresses this gap by building an interpretable model that forecasts regional crime trends—empowering communities and decision-makers with insights for proactive safety measures and data-driven interventions.

## 📊 Key Results
- Processed and integrated **360K+ records** from the **FBI Crime Data Explorer** and **Connecticut Open Data Portal**
- Engineered **spatial**, **temporal**, and **environmental** feature sets to improve predictive accuracy
- Trained multiple models: **LightGBM**, **Random Forest**, and a **custom Deep Neural Network (DNN)**
- Implemented **SMOTE** to mitigate severe class imbalance
- Built an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization and predictions

---

## ⚙️ Methodologies
To achieve the project goals, the team:
- Designed and executed an **end-to-end data pipeline** for ingestion, cleaning, and transformation  
- Implemented **multi-model training and evaluation** using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Applied **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** for balanced learning  
- Developed a **Streamlit dashboard** for inference, visualization, and user interactivity  
- Leveraged **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods to visualize feature influence and model transparency
